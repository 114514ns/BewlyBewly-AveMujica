## üëã Introduction

> [!IMPORTANT]
> BewlyBewly! Ave Mujica mainly focuses on page adjustments and optimization rather than improving functionally and efficiency.
>
> The dark mode will only be adapted to commonly used pages due to its efficiency and maintenance difficulty, while less
> frequently used pages will not to be adapted.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> BewlyBewly! Ave Mujica is a fork of [BewlyBewly](https://github.com/BewlyBewly/BewlyBewly), aiming to provide feature updates and bug fixes after the original project was archived.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you are installing this extension, your browser will probably say that it can read your browser history.
>
> This is because BewlyBewly! Ave Mujica uses the ["tabs" permission](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs), which can also be used to read each tab, allowing it to know the browsing history, but it is not utilized here.
>
> **Some browsers will mention the worst-case scenario and the highest risks, ensuring your safety after installation.**
> Additionally, this project is open source, so you can see what exactly what it does.

BewlyBewly is a browser extension for bilibili that aims to enhance the user experience by redesigning the bilibili UI.
The design is inspired by YouTube, Vision OS, and iOS, resulting in a more visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
This project uses the [vitesse-webext](https://github.com/antfu/vitesse-webext) template for development.
Without this template, it may not be possible to develop this project.
